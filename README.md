# dsek-frontend
this will eventually become the new d-sektionen.se

## TODO
known tasks that have to be fixed / completed:
1. <b>PageNav</b>: Make the page nav buttons display how many pages there are correctly. This should be based on posts per page. Also implement the funtionality for navigating to the next page as well as backwards.
2. <b>SideNav</b>: The sidenav currently does not display anything if you don't hover over it. Show text only when not hovering.
3. <b>Dropdown</b>: The dropdown appears to the right of the dropdown button when it in reality should appear below.
4. <b>Footer</b>: The footer currently has a hardcoded padding to keep it on the bottom. Make it appear on the bottom for every possible page layout or resolution.
5. <b>Styling & components for committee pages</b>: Every committee page needs to get styled based on their graphic profile and activities. Also, try to find parts of the pages that could be migrated to components.
6. ~~<b>Multiple content for widget</b>: Right now the component only allows one picture or paragraph. Make it possible to have mutiple images, paragraphs or both.~~
7. <b>Move 'protokoll styrelsemöten' & 'fotoalbum' to medlemstjänster</b>: You currently need to login in order to access these tabs, I believe the reason for this is related to STABEN. I think it makes more sense to move these pages to medlem.d-sektionen.se.
